Symmetrical arrays
Create a function named isSymmetric that takes an n√ón integer matrix (two dimensional array/list) as a parameter and returns true if the matrix is symmetric or false if it is not.

Symmetric means it has identical values along its diagonal axis from top-left to bottom-right, as in the first example.

Example 1:

[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 2, 2],
  [1, 2, 5]
]
i for the rows = 0
j for the cols = 0

if array[i, j+1] == array[j+1, i]

2. creating a list inside a class

public List<Pirate> Ship { get; set; }
         public bool HasCaptain { get; set; } = false;

          public PirateShip()
         {
             Ship = new List<Pirate>(); // why do we do this?
         }


Write a function that finds the largest element of an array using recursion.
function(array, n)
if n >= array.Length
    return the highest value;
else
    if someVar >= array[n]
        set var to that number
    else
        function(array, n+1)
